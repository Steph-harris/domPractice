        <h2>The Last Temptation of Homer</h2>
        <p>That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. I hope I didn't brain my damage.</p>
