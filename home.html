        <h2>The Last Temptation of Homer</h2>
        <p>That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. I hope I didn't brain my damage.</p>

                <p>Steve Smith: I can't believe I'm gonna die a virgin. Francine Smith: Aw, sweetie, there was a 70-80% chance of that happening, anyway. Roger the Alien: Hey, with this mortar launcher, we can get back at the kid who went all Tom Sizemore on your eye! Steve Smith: Oh, I wish I could get back at him. I'm gonna dress up as a girl and get him to have sex with me and then say "Ha! I'm not a girl! You just had sex with a boy that hates you!" Roger the Alien: Yes, let's leave that plan between you, me, and the string of therapists who won't be able to help you. Guy #1: It's all set, right? Guy #2: It's gonna be just like in Carrie. [Pulls rope; several squealing pigs fall on Stan] Guy #1: Pigs? It was supposed to be pig's blood. Guy #2: I didn't finish the book. Guy #1: You stopped reading after the word "pigs"? That wasn't even the end of the sentence.</p>
